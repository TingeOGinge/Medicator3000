This app acts as a daily reminder list for people who take lots of medication everyday.

There are 4 time slots allocated, akin to the traditional plastic boxes that are the inspiration for this webapp (Morning, Noon, Evening, Bed). 

The user should be able to customise the names of the medication in the time slots. It should be clear when the user has checked off a time slot as complete.
